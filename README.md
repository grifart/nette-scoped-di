# Nette DI Scope

Split your app dependency injection container into well-defined scopes and enforce relationships between them.

## Example

You have *model* where you want to expose access **only to** few facades. So you export them from *model* container into *app* container and the *app* then can **only access** those exported services. This means that *app* can no longer ignore ACL rules or directly access database.



## On the edge between monolith and microservices

This approach stays in the middle of monolith and microservices.

From architectonical perspective it is equavalent to microservices approach. There is clear boundary and interface between *model* and *app*.

Technically you save tons of hours of maintainace cost of managing microservices. Because there is still one app, but with many independent modules. They have clear boundaries and explicitly defined dependencies. And when you break this boundary, you get an exception. 

So if needed you can easily turn already defined modules into microservices later. Only part that is missing here is a serialization & networking stack. This can be easily solved by adding RPC layer between modules that are extracted into microservices.
